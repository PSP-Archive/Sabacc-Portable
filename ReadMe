Sabacc Basics 0.6.1 for PlayStation Portable
====== ====== ===== === =========== ========

Installation
===========+

I've included three different flavors in this build. I haven't tested them all, so feedback is definitely welcome. I have never built a kxploit game before, so I definitely need feedback if I did this right.

1. Copy the program itself
==========================

Copy EBOOT.PBP in the CFW folder to a folder of your choice within GAME/GAME3xx, GAME4XX or GAME5XX on your memory stick. For firmwares 3.0 to 3.9, replace GAME3xx with the appropriate version. For 4.xx use GAME4XX exactly as such, and similarly for 5.xx

2. Copy the data files
======================

No longer necessary, all data is built-in.

3. Play
=======

Self explanatory.

4. Special Thanks
=================
To Dark Alex, to which this wouldn't be possible.
To the devs of the PSP SDK and those who ported SDL and FreeType.
To Peter Schuster for the New Aurebesh font.
To the Ubuntu team for providing a great alternative to OS X on my iBook G4.


Feedback always welcome, and remember, I need some graphic artists! Please help!
