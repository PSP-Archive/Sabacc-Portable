Sabacc Basics 0.7.9 for PlayStation Portable
====== ====== ===== === =========== ========

Installation
============

I've included three different flavors in this build. I haven't tested them all, so feedback is definitely welcome. I have never built a kxploit game before, so I definitely need feedback if I did this right.

1. Copy the program itself
==========================

Copy EBOOT.PBP in the CFW folder to a folder of your choice within GAME/GAME3xx, GAME4XX or GAME5XX on your memory stick. For firmwares 3.0 to 3.9, replace GAME3xx with the appropriate version. For 4.xx use GAME4XX exactly as such, and similarly for 5.xx

2. Copy the data files
======================

This is no longer necessary, all data is built-in to the eboot package.

3. Play
=======

In the XMB, select Game -> Memory Stick -> Sabacc Portable.

4. Source
=========

If you're interested in helping, or just want to see my very ugly source (I am a complete novice coder), go to:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/sabaccportable/

To build the source, you'll need the PSP Toolchain and Libraries, available from www.ps2dev.org.

Please note, you'll need at least GNU CC 4.5.0.

5. Special Thanks
=================
To Dark Alex, to which this wouldn't be possible.
To the devs of the PSP SDK and those who ported SDL and FreeType.
To Peter Schuster for the New Aurebesh font.
To the Ubuntu team for providing a great alternative to OS X on my iBook G4.
To the Debian team, for providing a great OS, for which I ditched Ubuntu when I got tired of its bloat.
To the developers of the One True Editor: GNU Emacs.


Feedback always welcome, and remember, I need some graphic artists! Please help!
