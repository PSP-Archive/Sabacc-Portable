Sabacc Basics 0.7.2 for PlayStation Portable
====== ====== ===== === =========== ========

Installation
===========+

Since 0.7.0, the only build available is for firmware 3 and up. I no longer build for nor support firmware 1.50.

1. Copy the program itself
==========================

Copy EBOOT.PBP in the CFW folder to a folder of your choice within GAME/GAME3xx, GAME4XX or GAME5XX on your memory stick. For firmwares 3.0 to 3.9, replace GAME3xx with the appropriate version. For 4.xx use GAME4XX exactly as such, and similarly for 5.xx

2. Copy the data files
======================

No longer necessary, all data is built-in.

3. Play
=======

Self explanatory.

4. Special Thanks
=================
To Dark Alex, to which this wouldn't be possible.
To the devs of the PSP SDK and those who ported SDL and FreeType.
To Peter Schuster for the New Aurebesh font.
To the Debian team for providing a great alternative to OS X on my iBook G4 (Debian Lenny on an iBook is sweet). Sorry Ubuntu you're history. Yeah I know Ubuntu is Debian based, but Lenny runs so much faster and more reliably than Feisty, Gutsy, Hardy or Jaunty ever did on the iBook.


Feedback always welcome, and remember, I need some graphic artists! Please help!
